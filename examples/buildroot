build system

- download source for common packages
- apply patches for cross compilation, arch dependent bugs, etc
- build components
- assemble rootfs in staging area
- add your own packages

buildroot

-install libncurses5-dev

- packages need at least two files:
    - config.in: KConfig code adding the package to the config menu
    - <package_name>.mk
- packages do not contain code, they contain instructions to get, compile and add it to the rootfs

command in mk file:
$(eval $(generic-package))
